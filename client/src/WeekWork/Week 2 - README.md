# Project Progress Report  

## Week 2  
After gaining a better understanding of the APIs, each team member started working on their tasks, testing the APIs. Some questions arose and were answered in the group chat on Teams, as well as in discussions with the professor. João and Mahmoud also started testing the component styling using Tailwind, initially facing many issues due to conflicting Tailwind package versions. After a few calls during the week, the issue was resolved, and the necessary configurations were made. João also began organizing how the components would be displayed on the front end, creating some classes and styles for `App.tsx`. Regarding the back end, we encountered some problems related to the `.env` file, but after discussions and research, these issues were resolved.
