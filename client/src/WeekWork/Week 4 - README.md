# Project Progress Report  

## Week 4  
The `userInput`, `WeatherForecast`, and `SunriseSunset` components continued to be refined and were completed, maintaining a consistent style based on the proposed low-fi wireframe. This week, Pinar and Nikita integrated their components into the project. Pinar's component needed some polishing, and João suggested using Tailwind classes from other components to maintain consistency. After these adjustments, her component was finalized and fully functional. However, Nikita's component was still not working, both in functionality and styling. João and Mahmoud offered assistance by providing suggestions and even working on her code, but without success. The code was difficult to understand, and despite multiple attempts, it remained unresolved. Since the project deadline was approaching, we agreed to submit the project without this component being fully functional, suggesting that Nikita continue working on the adjustments until the project presentation. If necessary, we recommended that she rebuild the component from scratch directly within the project to see if that would lead to better results. We also emphasized the importance of ensuring that no other components were broken in the process, both in functionality and styling. Before pushing any updates to Git, we suggested that she carefully test the components and verify that the rest of the project remained unaffected. If issues were found, a code review should be conducted to identify and fix the problem before submitting updates to the repository.
